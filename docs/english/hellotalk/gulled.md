I interpret to improve the language of my parents, it's more of a past time not an actual real source of income, although I do get paid for it as well  
I was born and raised here in Sweden but my parents are from a country called Somaliland, right next to Djibouti on the horn of Africa  
That where my business is located, not here in Europe  
I'm going to need to reach fluency since I have to gain governmental officials trust  
And since I was born here in Sweden, I'm not 100% fluent yet, I hope you get a clearer picture now Nicolas  
I would consider myself a global child haha, since I spent a small part of my life in Ohio as well growing up, in my teenage years

Discussion about the NBA in the 90' (Detroit, Jordan, Drexler, Barkley). He loves Dirk and was very disappointed in 2006...  
Currently he makes business with Somaliland and Ethiopia on agriculture products. He wants to expand this business. When he will earn enough money he plans to launch a real estate projet in Sweden.
